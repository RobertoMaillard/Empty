# ImageEncryptor
Encrypt and decrypt images using a bitwise XOR one-time pad encryption.
Each RGB color binary number in each pixel in an image is encrypted separately 
using a random list of shifts equal to the amount, with a bitwise XOR operation.
The random list of shifts is generated with a stream of pseudorandom numbers.
# Instructions
Choose your images and type in an encryption key(long data type). 
Saves encrypted images as a PNG image adding XOR to filename in the same directory.
Decrypt images using the same key.
